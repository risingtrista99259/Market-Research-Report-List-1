<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neutral-density Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Reflective Type</li><li>Reflective Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Neutral-density filters (ND filters) are categorized into two main types: non-reflective and reflective. Non-reflective ND filters are often made from optical glass or resin, allowing for consistent light transmission without color distortions, making them ideal for photography and cinematography. Reflective ND filters, on the other hand, utilize coatings that reflect specific wavelengths of light, providing effective light reduction while maintaining image quality. Both types are crucial in managing exposure, enabling creative control in various imaging applications.</p></p>
