<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Parenteral Drugs Plastic Packaging Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC)</li><li>Polyolefin</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Parenteral drugs plastic packaging primarily involves two types: Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) and Polyolefin. PVC is widely used due to its strength, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness, making it suitable for various formulations and storage conditions. However, concerns about leachables and environmental impact are prominent. Polyolefin, on the other hand, offers superior chemical resistance and lower extractable risks, making it a safer option for sensitive drugs. Its versatility in applications contributes to its growing adoption in parenteral packaging solutions.</p></p>
